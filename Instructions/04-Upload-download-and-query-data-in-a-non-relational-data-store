Lab:
    title: 'Upload, download, and query data in a non-relational data store'
---

## Instructions
In the sample scenario, suppose that you've created the following data stores:

A Cosmos DB for holding information about the products that Contoso manufactures.
A blob container in Azure Storage for holding the images of products.
A file share, in the same Azure Storage account, for holding product documentation.
In this exercise, you'll upload data to these data stores. You'll run queries against the data in the Cosmos DB database. Finally, you'll download and view the images and documents held in Azure Storage.

You'll perform this exercise using the Azure portal and the command line.
