Lab:
    title: 'Provision non-relational Azure data services'
---

## Instructions
In the sample scenario, you've decided to create the following data stores:

* A Cosmos DB for holding information about the volume of items in stock. You need to store current and historic information about volume levels, so you can track how levels vary over time. The data is recorded daily.
* A Data Lake store for holding production and quality data.
* A blob container for holding images of the products the company manufactures.
* File storage for sharing reports.

In this lab, you'll provision and configure the Cosmos DB account, and test it by creating a database, a container, and a sample document. You'll also provision an Azure Storage account that can provide blob, file, and Data Lake storage.
