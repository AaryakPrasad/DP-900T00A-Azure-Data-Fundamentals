## Explore Azure SQL Database

In this exercise you'll provision an Azure SQL Database resource in your Azure subscription, and then use SQL to query the tables in a relational database.

> **Note**: The exercise is part of a module on Microsoft Learn, and includes an option to use a *sandbox* Azure subscription. However, if you are completing this exercise as part of an instructor-led class, you should use the Azure subscription provided as part of the class instead of the sandbox.

> **Further learning**: If you have time later, you can return to this exercise on Microsoft Learn and try the alternative options to provision Azure Database for PostgreSQL or MySQL.
