## Explore Azure Storage

In this exercise you'll provision an Azure Storage account in your Azure subscription, and explore the various ways you can use it to store data.

> **Note**: The exercise is part of a module on Microsoft Learn, and includes an option to use a *sandbox* Azure subscription. However, if you are completing this exercise as part of an instructor-led class, you should use the Azure subscription provided as part of the class instead of the sandbox.
