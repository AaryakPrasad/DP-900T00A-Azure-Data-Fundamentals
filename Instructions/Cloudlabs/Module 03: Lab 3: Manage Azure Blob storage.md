# Manage Azure Blob storage

In this exercise, you'll learn how to create and manage blobs, and the containers that hold them. You can do this using the Azure portal, or using the Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell from the command line.


# Task 1: Using Azure portal

## Create an Azure Storage container:

In an Azure storage account, you store blobs in containers. A container provides a convenient way of grouping related blobs together, and you can organize blobs in a hierarchy of folders inside a container, similar to files in a file system on disk.

You create a container in an Azure Storage account. 

1.  In the Azure portal, in the left-hand navigation menu, select **Home**.

    ![](media/lab4/task3/1.png)

2.  On the Home page, select **Storage accounts**, and then select the **storage account** present in the page that starts with the name **storage**. Copy the storage account name into a notepad for later tasks.

    ![](media/lab4/select-storage.png)

3.  On the Storage Account page, under **Data storage**, select **Containers**. On the Containers page, select **+ Container** to create a new container.

    ![](media/lab4/create-container.png)

4. On the new container create page, provide name as **images** and select **blob** in **Public access level** dropdown. Click on **create**.

### Upload a blob to Azure Storage:

 After you've created a container, you can upload blobs. Depending on how you want to organize your blobs, you can also create folders in the container.

1. In the Azure portal, in the left-hand navigation menu, select **Home**.

    ![](media/lab4/task3/1.png)

2. On the Home page, select **Storage accounts**, and then select the storage account present in the page that starts with the name **storage**.

    ![](media/lab4/select-storage.png)

3. On the Storage Account page, under **Data storage**, select **Containers**. On the Containers page, click on **images**.

    ![](media/lab4/images-select.png)
    
4. Now click on **Upload**, it will open file upload window, select file icon then browse to **C:\Users\azureuser\Desktop\lab\images** then select all files (Press Ctrl+A) and upload it.

    ![](media/lab4/images-upload3.png)     

5. The Advanced drop-down section provides options you can modify the default options. For example, you can specify the name of a folder in the container (the folder will be created if it doesn't exist), the type of blob, and the access tier. The blob that is created is named after the file you uploaded. Click on **Upload**.

    ![](media/lab4/images-upload2.png)

### List the blobs in a container:

After you've uploaded files to a container, you can view them in the container folder.

1. On the Storage Account page, under **Data storage**, select **Containers**. On the Containers page, click on **images**.

    ![](media/lab4/images-select.png)
    
2. The uploaded images can be shown here:

    ![](media/lab4/list-blobs.png)   

### Download a blob from a container:

1. On the Storage Account page, under **Data storage**, select **Containers**. On the Containers page, click on **images**.

    ![](media/lab4/images-select.png)
    
2. In the list of files select any file, it will open a window with details of the file which is selected. Now click on **Download** to download the file.    

    ![](media/lab4/download-blob.png)

### Delete a blob from a container

Deleting a blob can reclaim the resources used in the storage container. However, if you've enabled the soft delete option for the storage account, the blob is hidden rather than removed, and you can restore it later.

1. On the Storage Account page, under **Data management**, select **Data protection**. Now select check box **Enable soft delete for blobs** to enable soft delete on blobs then **select Save**.

    ![](media/lab4/soft-delete.png)

2. Now on the Storage Account page, under **Data storage**, select **Containers**. On the Containers page, click on **images**.

    ![](media/lab4/images-select.png)
    
3. In the list of files select any file, it will open a window with details of the file which is selected. Now click on **Delete** to delete and select **OK** to delete file.    

    ![](media/lab4/delete-blob.png)

4. Now click on **Show deleted blobs** to view the deleted files.

    ![](media/lab4/show-deleted-blobs.png)
    
### Delete an Azure Storage container:

1. On the Storage Account page, under **Data storage**, select **Containers**. On the Containers page, select **images** then click on **Delete** and select **OK**.

    ![](media/lab4/delete-container.png)
    
### Task 2: Using Azure CLI
--------------------------------
