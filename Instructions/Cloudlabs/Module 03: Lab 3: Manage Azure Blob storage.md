# Manage Azure Blob storage

In this exercise, you'll learn how to create and manage blobs, and the containers that hold them.


### Task 1: Create an Azure Storage container
--------------------------------
In an Azure storage account, you store blobs in containers. A container provides a convenient way of grouping related blobs together, and you can organize blobs in a hierarchy of folders inside a container, similar to files in a file system on disk.

You create a container in an Azure Storage account. You can do this using the Azure portal, or using the Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell from the command line.

1.  In the Azure portal, in the left-hand navigation menu, select Home

2.  On the Home page, select Storage accounts, and then select the storage account present in the page that starts with the name **storage**. Copy the storage account name into a notepad for later tasks.

3.  On the Storage Account page, under **Data storage**, select **Containers**. On the Containers page, select **+ Container** to create a new container.
