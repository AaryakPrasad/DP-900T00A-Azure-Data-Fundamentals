# Explore Azure Cosmos DB

In this exercise, you'll provision an Azure Cosmos DB database in your Azure subscription, and explore the various ways you can use it to store non-relational data.

## Exercise 1 : Explore Azure Cosmos DB

### Task 1 : Create a Cosmos DB account

To use Cosmos DB, you must provision a Cosmos DB account in your Azure subscription. In this exercise, you'll provision a Cosmos DB account that uses the core (SQL) API.

1.  In the Azure portal, select  **+ Create a resource**  at the top left, and search for  _Azure Cosmos DB_. In the results, select  **Azure Cosmos DB**  and select  **Create**.

2.  In the  **Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL**  tile, select  **Create**.

3.  Enter the following details, and then select  **Review + Create**:
    -   **Subscription**: If you're using a sandbox, select  _Concierge Subscription_. Otherwise, select your Azure subscription.
    -   **Resource group**: If you're using a sandbox, select the existing resource group (which will have a name like  _learn-xxxx..._). Otherwise, create a new resource group with a name of your choice.
    -   **Account Name**: Enter a unique name
    -   **Location**: Choose any available location
    -   **Capacity mode**: Provisioned throughput
    -   **Apply Free-Tier Discount**: Select Apply if available
    -   **Limit total account throughput**: Unselected

4.  When the configuration has been validated, select  **Create**.

5.  Wait for deployment to complete. Then go to the deployed resource.

### Task 2 : Create a sample database

1.  On the page for your new Cosmos DB account, in the pane n the left, select  **Data Explorer**.

2.  In the  **Data Explorer**  page, select  **Start with Sample**  and then observe the status in the panel at the bottom of the screen until the  **SampleDB**  database and the sample  **Persons**  container has been created (which may take a minute or so).

3.  Select  **Close**  on the notification message.

### Task 3 : View and create items

1.  In the Data Explorer page, expand the  **SampleDB**  database and the Persons container, and select  **Items**  to see a list of items in the container. The items represent people, each with a unique id, a firstname, an age, and other properties.

2.  Select any of the items in the list to see a JSON representation of the item data.

3.  At the top of the page, select  **New Item**  to create a new blank item.

4.  Modify the JSON for the new item as follows, and then select  **Save**.


```
{
    "id": "123",
    "firstname": "Bob",
    "age": 54
}

```
5.  After saving the new item, notice that additional metadata properties are added automatically.

### Task 4  : Query the database

1.  In the  **Data Explorer**  page, select the  **New SQL Query**  icon.

2.  In the SQL Query editor, review the default query (`SELECT * FROM c`) and use the  **Execute Query**  button to run it.

3.  Review the results, which includes the full JSON representation of all items.

4.  Modify the query as follows:

```
SELECT c.id, c.firstname, c.age
FROM c
WHERE c.age > 40

```

5.  Use the  **Execute Query**  button to run the revised query and review the results, which includes JSON containing the id, firstname, and age fields for person items with an age greater than 40.
    
6.  Close the SQL Query editor, discarding your changes.
    
    You've seen how to create and query JSON entities in a Cosmos DB database by using the data explorer interface in the Azure portal. In a real scenario, an application developer would use one of the many programming language specific software development kits (SDKs) to call the core (SQL) API and work with data in the database.
